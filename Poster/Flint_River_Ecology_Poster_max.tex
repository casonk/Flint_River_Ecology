    \normalsize 
    \item The Hamilton Dam is the terminal dam on the 
    Flint River and was constructed in 1920. 
    The dam is in the urban city of Flint, Michigan and prevents fish passage upstream, 
    but many fish migrate from the Great Lakes to this dam during spawning periods.
    \item Upstream reaches of the Hamilton dam consist of a wide riparian zone, 
    whereas downstream is composed mainly of cemented structures.

    \item Due to habitat availability, 
    water \\ quality scores based on benthic 
    macroinvertebrate communities will be higher upstream than downstream.
    \item Because many Great Lakes fishes \\ migrate to the dam, 
    fish population \\ diversity indices will be higher
    \\ downstream of this terminal dam than upstream.

    \item Benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled \\ upstream and 
    downstream of the dam in the spring and fall and water quality scores were assessed.
    \item Fish species were obtained and  measured, weighed, tagged (Figure 3), 
    and released and diversity indices were compared downstream vs. upstream.

%%% Discussion %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\headerbox{Discussion}{name=box30, column=3, row=0}{
  \textbf{Hypothesis 1 was supported only in \\ non-piscivorous fish.}
  \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=11.5pt] \small
    \item Mercury levels were higher in  paired species caught downstream vs 
    upstream except in \\ piscivorous fish (Figure 4).
    \item There were more species downstream with higher levels of mercury likely due 
    to the fact that Great Lakes–influenced fish bring more contaminants downstream.
  \end{itemize} 
  \textbf{Hypothesis 2 was supported.}
  \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=11.5pt] \small
    \item Water quality scores based on benthic macroinvertebrates were ``good'' upstream, 
    and downstream we found a lot of zebra \\ mussels rather than benthic \\ macroinvertebrates (Figure 5).
    \item Water quality scores based on benthic macroinvertebrates in the 
    City of Flint are lower where channelization of the river is \\ common.
  \end{itemize}
  \textbf{Hypothesis 3 was not supported.}
  \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=11.5pt] \small
    \item Using Simpson’s diversity index fish diversity was found to be lower 
    downstream, 0.67, than upstream, 0.75.
    \item Even though 31 species were caught downstream vs. 20 upstream, 
    the overall catch was dominated by Gizzard shad downstream, 
    making the species evenness and thus the diversity less than upstream (Figure 6).
