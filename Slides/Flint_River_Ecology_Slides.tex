        \iast The Hamilton Dam, constructed in 1920, resides in the urban city of Flint, Michigan and was utilized for logging and the automobile industry. \vspace{2.5mm} % \pause
        \iast The Dam no longer serves this purpose and is in the process of removal to revert the stream to its natural ecology. \vspace{2.5mm} % \pause
        \iast Upstream reaches of the Hamilton dam consist of a wide riparian zone, whereas downstream is composed of cemented structures with trapped debris. \vspace{2.5mm} % \pause
        \iast The Great Lakes have been polluted through agriculture, urbanization, and industrialization that introduced chemicals such as 
        PFAS, PCBs, and heavy metals, including; Hg, As, Cr, Pb, and Cd. 
        These have been found in higher concentrations in reservoirs above dams \textbf{[ 1 ]}.

%     \begin{itemize}
%         \iast Using Simpson's Diversity Index we compared species diversity above and below the dam.
%         We computed relative index values for the four sites $ (S), D_{S_{3}} = 0.48 \le D_{S_{4}} = 0.72 \le D_{S_{1}} = 0.77 = D_{S_{2}} = 0.77 $. \vspace{2.5mm} \pause
%         \iast Downstream yielded an index of 0.67 with 31 species caught. 
%         The overall catch was dominated by Gizzard shad making it less even than upstream. \vspace{2.5mm} \pause
%         \iast Upstream yielded an index of 0.75 with 20 species caught. 
%         Though there was less species diversity, it yielded a higher index because there was more eveness among the species caught.

% \begin{frame}
%     \frametitle{Discussion} % \pause
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \iast The dam prevents species from traveling upstream, we caught more species below the dam. 
%         Fishing methods upstream differed from downstream due to the different habitats. 
%         This could impact the fish species caught and the quantities. \vspace{2.5mm} \pause
%         \iast Mercury levels were analyzed in fish above and below the dam.
%         Bass contained higher levels of mercury compared to other species. 
%         Fish higher in the trophic level bioaccumulate more than other species. 
%         Downstream had more species with higher levels of mercury. 
%         This could be due to downstream containing species that are migrating from The Great Lakes.

    \textbf{ \Large \hspace{5mm}
        The ecology study of the Flint River has been conducted for 2 years. 
        Study will be continued through the removal of the Hamilton Dam and restoration of the Flint River. 
        This pre-assessment will be used to compare data once restoration is 
        complete to understand how dam removal impacts riverine ecosystems.
